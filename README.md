# HTML5 Semantic Web Page - Assignment

## Overview
This project is a simple HTML5 web page that demonstrates semantic structure, accessibility best practices, and beginner SEO techniques. The goal was to create a page that is easy for both humans and machines to understand.

## Design Choices
- **Semantic HTML5**: I used `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to provide clear structure and landmarks for assistive technologies.
- **Heading Hierarchy**: The page follows a logical order (H1 → H2 → H3), making content easy to navigate and improving SEO clarity.
- **Accessibility**: Added `aria-label` for navigation, descriptive link text, and structured lists for readability by screen readers.
- **SEO**: Included `<title>`, `<meta description>`, and keyword rich but natural headings. The content is written in clear, descriptive language to support discoverability.
- **Text-only focus**: No CSS or JavaScript was used, as the assignment emphasized structure.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the page.
2. The file is structured to be fully accessible and SEO-friendly without additional styling.
